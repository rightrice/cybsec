**CVE**

CVE's are a huge part of cybsec, whether you use them for good or not so good things is up to you. I simply put them on the internet for educational purposes. Your morals, your choice :) Anywho, this directory is a collection of Proof of Concept's (PoC's) for the CVE named in the file name.
